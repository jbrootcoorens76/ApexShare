### Test Structure Template

```typescript
import { uploadQueueManager } from '@/services/uploadQueueManager'

describe('Upload Queue Manager - [Category] Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    uploadQueueManager.destroy()
    // Setup mocks and initial state
  })

  afterEach(() => {
    uploadQueueManager.destroy()
    // Cleanup
  })

  test('should [description of test]', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  })
})
```

## üöÄ Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration

Add to your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Run Upload Queue Manager Tests
  run: |
    npm install
    node run-comprehensive-tests.js
```

### Performance Regression Detection

Set up automated performance monitoring:
1. Baseline performance metrics collection
2. Performance comparison on each build
3. Alerts for significant regressions
4. Performance trend tracking

## üìä Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Monitor these metrics in production:

#### Upload Performance
- Average upload speed (target: >5 MB/s)
- 95th percentile response time (target: <2s)
- Success rate (target: >95%)

#### System Health
- Memory usage (target: <200MB baseline)
- Error rate (target: <5%)
- Concurrent upload capacity (target: >10)

#### User Experience
- Time to first progress update (target: <500ms)
- Queue processing latency (target: <100ms)
- UI responsiveness (target: <16ms frame time)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Test Issues

#### Test Timeouts
- Increase timeout in test files: `jest.setTimeout(60000)`
- Check for unresolved promises
- Verify mock implementations

#### Mock Failures
- Ensure all external dependencies are mocked
- Check mock return values match expected interface
- Verify async mock implementations

#### Performance Variations
- Run tests multiple times for consistency
- Account for system resource availability
- Use relative performance comparisons

### Debugging Test Failures

1. **Enable Detailed Logging**:
   ```typescript
   // In test setup
   process.env.DEBUG = 'upload-queue-manager'
   ```

2. **Check Test Output**:
   - Review console outputs for error details
   - Examine generated reports for metrics
   - Verify mock call patterns

3. **Isolate Issues**:
   - Run individual test suites
   - Comment out failing tests temporarily
   - Check for test interdependencies
