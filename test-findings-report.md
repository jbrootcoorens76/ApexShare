# End-to-End Upload Test Findings Report

## Executive Summary

The comprehensive end-to-end testing has **successfully reproduced the user's exact issue** and identified the root causes. The tests reveal that **even the previously "working" curl commands now fail**, indicating that the API Gateway model deployment has not been completed or has been reverted.

## Key Findings

### 1. API Gateway Model Deployment Issue ‚ùå
- **ALL requests return 400 "Invalid request body"**
- Even the exact curl command that previously worked now fails
- This confirms the CDK deployment changes have not taken effect
- The API Gateway is still using the old request validation model

### 2. Session Endpoint Requires Authentication ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Session GET endpoint returns 401 "Valid authorization token required"
- Upload endpoint (POST) allows unauthenticated requests but fails validation
- This is expected behavior for the session management

### 3. CORS Configuration is Correct ‚úÖ
- OPTIONS request returns proper CORS headers
- `access-control-allow-origin: https://apexshare.be`
- `access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type,Authorization,X-Requested-With,Accept,Origin`
- `access-control-allow-methods: GET,POST,OPTIONS`

### 4. Frontend vs Backend Mismatch Confirmed üéØ
- Frontend sends: `{ fileName, fileSize, mimeType }`
- API expects: `{ fileName, fileSize, contentType }`
- However, **even contentType requests are failing**, indicating deployment issue

## Test Results Summary

| Test Scenario | Direct API | Custom Domain | Status |
|---------------|------------|---------------|---------|
| Frontend payload (mimeType) | 400 | 400 | ‚ùå Failed |
| Curl payload (contentType) | 400 | 400 | ‚ùå Failed |
| Legacy full payload | 400 | 400 | ‚ùå Failed |
| Minimal payload | 400 | 400 | ‚ùå Failed |
| Empty payload | 400 | 400 | ‚ùå Failed |

**Result: 0/10 working combinations**

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: API Gateway Model Not Deployed
The API Gateway is still using the old request validation model, which means:
1. The CDK changes were not successfully deployed to production
2. OR the API Gateway model was not updated during deployment
3. OR there's a caching issue preventing the new model from taking effect

### Secondary Issue: Frontend Field Name Mismatch
Once the API Gateway model is properly deployed, the frontend will still fail because:
- Frontend sends `mimeType` field
- API expects `contentType` field

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Fix API Gateway Deployment üö® **HIGH PRIORITY**
```bash
# Re-deploy the CDK stack to ensure model changes take effect
npm run deploy:production

# Verify deployment completed successfully
aws apigateway get-models --rest-api-id l0hx9zgow8 --region eu-west-1
```

### 2. Verify Model Update
Create a test to verify the new model is active:
```bash
# Run verification test after deployment
node quick-validation-test.js
```

### 3. Fix Frontend Field Name (After API is fixed)
Update `/Users/jimmybrootcoorens/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/JBIT /apps/ApexShare/frontend/src/services/api.ts` line 251:
```typescript
// Change from:
mimeType, // Correct field name for upload model

// To:
contentType, // Correct field name for upload model
```

## Verification Steps

### Before Any Fixes
```bash
# All these should return 400 "Invalid request body"
curl -X POST "https://l0hx9zgow8.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/sessions/b1dcd4ef-c043-4f83-a73e-b9b8dfc62893/upload" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fileName":"test.mp4","fileSize":1000,"contentType":"video/mp4"}'
```

### After API Gateway Fix
```bash
# This should return 200 with upload URL
curl -X POST "https://l0hx9zgow8.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/sessions/b1dcd4ef-c043-4f83-a73e-b9b8dfc62893/upload" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fileName":"test.mp4","fileSize":1000,"contentType":"video/mp4"}'
```

### After Frontend Fix
- User should be able to upload videos successfully through the web interface

## Test Artifacts Created

1. **`comprehensive-e2e-upload-test.js`** - Full test suite reproducing user issue
2. **`focused-issue-analysis.js`** - Detailed analysis of specific failure points
3. **`quick-validation-test.js`** - Quick verification test for post-fix validation
4. **This report** - Complete findings and action plan

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Test reproduces user's exact issue**
‚úÖ **Identifies specific root causes**
‚úÖ **Provides clear action items**
‚úÖ **Creates verification tests for fixes**

The testing strategy has successfully:
- Reproduced the exact 400 Bad Request error users experience
- Identified that API Gateway model deployment is the primary blocker
- Confirmed the secondary frontend field name issue
- Created repeatable tests to verify fixes

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy CDK changes** to update API Gateway model
2. **Run verification test** to confirm deployment success
3. **Update frontend field name** from `mimeType` to `contentType`
4. **Test complete user flow** to ensure resolution
