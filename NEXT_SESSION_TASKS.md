```typescript
✅ GET /sessions                  // List sessions (working - minor pagination enhancement needed)
✅ POST /sessions                 // Create new training session (working)
✅ GET /sessions/{id}             // Get specific session details (working)
✅ PUT /sessions/{id}             // Update session information (working)

export const handler = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> => {
  const { httpMethod, pathParameters, queryStringParameters, body } = event;

  switch (httpMethod) {
    case 'GET':
      if (pathParameters?.sessionId) {
        return await getSession(pathParameters.sessionId);
      } else {
        return await listSessions(queryStringParameters);
      }
    case 'POST':
      return await createSession(JSON.parse(body || '{}'));
    case 'PUT':
      return await updateSession(pathParameters?.sessionId, JSON.parse(body || '{}'));
    case 'DELETE':
      return await deleteSession(pathParameters?.sessionId);
    default:
      return { statusCode: 405, body: 'Method Not Allowed' };
  }
};
```

### Analytics Handler Structure
```typescript
// lambda/analytics-handler/index.ts
export const handler = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> => {
  const { httpMethod, path, queryStringParameters, body } = event;

  if (path.endsWith('/usage') && httpMethod === 'GET') {
    return await getUsageMetrics(queryStringParameters?.period || '30d');
  } else if (path.endsWith('/events') && httpMethod === 'POST') {
    return await trackEvent(JSON.parse(body || '{}'));
  }

  return { statusCode: 404, body: 'Not Found' };
};
```
