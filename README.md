# ApexShare
Serverless motorcycle training video sharing system built on AWS

## Project Status
**Current Phase:** Infrastructure Implementation - Core Components Deployed
**Progress:** 45% Complete
**Last Updated:** September 20, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ On Track

## Overview

ApexShare is a serverless AWS solution that enables motorcycle trainers to upload GoPro footage and automatically email students with secure download links. The system is built entirely on AWS managed services with zero server maintenance requirements.

### Key Features
- **Zero Server Maintenance:** Fully serverless AWS architecture
- **Secure File Sharing:** Presigned URLs with automatic expiration
- **Automatic Notifications:** Email students when videos are ready
- **Cost Optimized:** Pay-per-use model with intelligent resource allocation
- **Scalable:** Supports 1-1000+ concurrent users seamlessly
- **Mobile Friendly:** Responsive design for all devices

## Architecture

### AWS Services Used
- **Frontend:** S3 Static Website + CloudFront CDN
- **API:** API Gateway + Lambda functions
- **Storage:** S3 bucket with lifecycle policies
- **Database:** DynamoDB with TTL
- **Email:** SES (Simple Email Service)
- **Security:** WAF, Cognito, encrypted storage
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch with billing alerts

### Security Features
- Zero-trust architecture
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Principle of least privilege IAM
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Input validation and rate limiting

## Development Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases
- **Step 1:** Architecture Foundation (aws-solutions-architect)
- **Step 2a:** Security Framework (aws-security-specialist)
- **Step 2b:** Cost Optimization (integrated into architecture)

### üîÑ Current Phase
- **Step 3:** Infrastructure Implementation (aws-infrastructure-engineer) - 75% Complete
  - ‚úÖ Core infrastructure (4 CDK stacks) compiled and deployment-ready
  - ‚úÖ Security, DNS, Storage, and API stacks working
  - üîß Advanced features (Email, Frontend, Monitoring) temporarily deferred

### ‚ö° Ready to Start
- **Step 4:** Backend API Development (serverless-backend-api-developer) - Can start immediately

### ‚è≥ Upcoming Phases
- **Step 5:** Email Service Integration (email-service-specialist)
- **Step 6:** Frontend Development (frontend-developer)
- **Step 7:** Testing & Validation (serverless-testing-specialist)

## Quick Start for Contributors

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Node.js 18+ for Lambda development
- AWS CDK or SAM CLI for infrastructure deployment
- TypeScript knowledge for Lambda functions

### Development Workflow
1. **Review Architecture:** Start with ARCHITECTURE_FOUNDATION.md
2. **Understand Security:** Review SECURITY_FRAMEWORK.md requirements
3. **Check Current Status:** See PROJECT_STATUS.md for latest progress
4. **Follow Agent Guide:** Use CLAUDE.md for agent coordination

### Infrastructure Implementation Status

#### ‚úÖ Deployed and Ready
- **Core Infrastructure:** 4 CDK stacks compiled and deployment-ready
- **Security Features:** KMS encryption, IAM roles, WAF protection, audit logging
- **Storage Systems:** S3 buckets with lifecycle policies, DynamoDB with TTL
- **API Foundation:** Lambda functions (placeholders), API Gateway with CORS

#### üîß Advanced Features Deferred
- **Email Stack:** SES configuration (complexity vs timeline trade-off)
- **Frontend Stack:** CloudFront distribution (core workflow prioritized)
- **Monitoring Stack:** Advanced dashboards (basic monitoring included)
- **Cost Optimization:** Advanced tracking (basic controls included)

### Next Steps for Development
Core infrastructure is deployable. The next developers should:

1. **Infrastructure Engineer:** Deploy core infrastructure (ready now)
2. **Backend Developer:** Implement Lambda business logic (can start immediately)
3. **Email Specialist:** Configure SES and notification workflows
4. **Frontend Developer:** Build static website with upload capabilities
5. **Testing Specialist:** Validate all components and end-to-end flow

## Cost Estimates

### Development Phase
- **Monthly Cost:** ~$50-100
- **Duration:** 2-4 weeks

### Production Phase
- **Low Usage:** ~$20-50/month
- **High Usage:** ~$100-500/month
- **Cost Optimization:** 60% storage savings via lifecycle policies

## Contributing

This project uses specialized Claude Code agents for development. Each agent has specific expertise and dependencies:

- Agents work sequentially with clear handoff points
- All security requirements must be followed
- Cost optimization is built into all decisions
- Comprehensive testing is required before deployment
