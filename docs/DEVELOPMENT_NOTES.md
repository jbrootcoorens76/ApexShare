# ApexShare - Development Notes

**Created:** September 19, 2025
**Maintained By:** Documentation Manager
**Purpose:** Track technical decisions, integration points, and guidance for future development phases

## Foundation Phase Decisions (Steps 1-2)

### Architecture Decisions Made

#### Service Selection Rationale
| Service | Decision | Justification | Alternatives Considered |
|---------|----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| **API Gateway** | REST API with regional endpoint | Managed service, built-in throttling, CORS support | ALB + Lambda, Direct Lambda URLs |
| **Lambda Runtime** | Node.js 20.x | Best AWS support, TypeScript compatibility, ecosystem | Python 3.12, Java 21 |
| **Database** | DynamoDB | Serverless, automatic scaling, single-digit latency | RDS Aurora Serverless, DocumentDB |
| **Storage** | S3 Standard with lifecycle | 99.999999999% durability, lifecycle cost optimization | EFS, FSx |
| **CDN** | CloudFront | Global distribution, S3 integration, SSL termination | Direct S3, third-party CDN |
| **Email** | SES | High deliverability, AWS native, cost-effective | SendGrid, Mailgun, SNS |

#### Key Technical Patterns Established

**1. Presigned URL Pattern**
```
Frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → Generate Presigned URL → Return to Frontend
Frontend → Direct S3 Upload using Presigned URL
S3 → Event Trigger → Lambda → Process Upload → Send Email
```

**2. DynamoDB Access Patterns**
- **PK:** `UPLOAD#{fileId}` - Primary access by file ID
- **SK:** `METADATA#{uploadDate}` - Sort by date for listing
- **GSI1PK:** `STUDENT#{email}` - Query uploads by student email
- **GSI1SK:** `DATE#{uploadDate}` - Sort student uploads by date
- **GSI2PK:** `DATE#{YYYY-MM-DD}` - Query uploads by date
- **TTL:** 90 days automatic cleanup

**3. Security Patterns**
- Zero-trust: Verify every request, trust nothing
- Principle of least privilege: Minimal IAM permissions
- Encryption everywhere: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- Input validation: All endpoints validate input data

### Cost Optimization Decisions

#### S3 Lifecycle Strategy
```
Day 0-7: S3 Standard (frequent access)
Day 7-30: S3 Intelligent-Tiering (automatic optimization)
Day 30+: Automatic deletion (videos expire)
```
**Impact:** 60% cost reduction compared to keeping all in Standard

#### Lambda Optimization
- **Upload Handler:** 256MB memory, 30s timeout (cost vs performance optimized)
- **Email Sender:** 512MB memory, 2min timeout (handles email templates)
- **Download Handler:** 256MB memory, 30s timeout (simple presigned URL generation)

#### DynamoDB Strategy
- On-demand billing (unpredictable usage pattern)
- TTL enabled for automatic cleanup (prevents cost accumulation)
- Single table design (reduces costs and complexity)

### Security Framework Decisions

#### Authentication Strategy
**Decision:** Cognito User Pools with optional authentication
**Rationale:**
- Allows both authenticated trainers and anonymous students
- JWT tokens for API access
- Built-in user management and password policies

#### File Access Security
**Decision:** Presigned URLs with short expiration
**Implementation:**
- Upload URLs: 1 hour expiration
- Download URLs: 24 hour expiration
- No direct S3 public access
- Metadata tracking for audit trail

#### API Security
**Decision:** Multi-layer security approach
**Layers:**
1. WAF for DDoS protection and rate limiting
2. API Gateway rate limiting (10 requests/second per IP)
3. Lambda input validation and sanitization
4. IAM roles with minimal permissions

## Integration Points for Future Phases

## Step 3: Infrastructure Implementation Decisions (September 20, 2025)

### Major Technical Decisions Made

#### Iterative Implementation Strategy
**Decision:** Deploy core infrastructure first, defer advanced features
**Rationale:**
- Foundation infrastructure is solid and deployment-ready
- Advanced features add complexity without blocking core functionality
- Enables parallel backend development to start immediately
- Reduces risk by validating core components first

**Implementation:**
- 4 core stacks ready: Security, DNS, Storage, API
- 4 advanced stacks deferred: Email, Frontend, Monitoring, Cost Optimization

#### CDK Compilation and TypeScript Resolution
**Issues Encountered:**
- TypeScript compilation errors in CDK stack definitions
- Circular dependency issues between stacks
- AWS SDK version compatibility problems

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Resolved all TypeScript compilation errors through proper typing
- Eliminated circular dependencies with proper stack ordering
- Used stable AWS CDK patterns for resource definitions
- Implemented consistent naming conventions across all resources

**Technical Achievement:**
- `npm run build` executes successfully
- `cdk synth --all` generates proper CloudFormation templates
- All 4 core stacks are deployment-ready

#### Advanced Feature Deferral Strategy

**Email Stack Deferral:**
- **Issue:** SES configuration requires domain verification and reputation management
- **Decision:** Defer until after core functionality is validated
- **Impact:** Email notifications not available initially
- **Workaround:** Core upload/download workflow works without email notifications
- **Future Implementation:** Can be added as separate deployment phase

**Frontend Stack Deferral:**
- **Issue:** CloudFront distribution configuration adds complexity
- **Decision:** Use direct S3 static website hosting initially
- **Impact:** No global CDN initially
- **Workaround:** S3 static website hosting sufficient for initial testing
- **Future Implementation:** CloudFront can be added for performance optimization

**Monitoring Stack Deferral:**
- **Issue:** Advanced CloudWatch dashboards nice-to-have vs essential
- **Decision:** Basic monitoring sufficient for initial deployment
- **Impact:** No custom dashboards initially
- **Workaround:** AWS default monitoring and basic CloudWatch logging
- **Future Implementation:** Advanced monitoring after core functionality proven

**Cost Optimization Stack Deferral:**
- **Issue:** AWS SDK v3 compatibility issues with cost tracking functions
- **Decision:** Basic cost controls sufficient for initial deployment
- **Impact:** No automated cost tracking initially
- **Workaround:** S3 lifecycle policies and DynamoDB TTL provide basic cost control
- **Future Implementation:** Advanced cost tracking after SDK migration

### Infrastructure Implementation Results
