# ApexShare - Development Notes

**Created:** September 19, 2025
**Maintained By:** Documentation Manager
**Purpose:** Track technical decisions, integration points, and guidance for future development phases

## Foundation Phase Decisions (Steps 1-2)

### Architecture Decisions Made

#### Service Selection Rationale
| Service | Decision | Justification | Alternatives Considered |
|---------|----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| **API Gateway** | REST API with regional endpoint | Managed service, built-in throttling, CORS support | ALB + Lambda, Direct Lambda URLs |
| **Lambda Runtime** | Node.js 20.x | Best AWS support, TypeScript compatibility, ecosystem | Python 3.12, Java 21 |
| **Database** | DynamoDB | Serverless, automatic scaling, single-digit latency | RDS Aurora Serverless, DocumentDB |
| **Storage** | S3 Standard with lifecycle | 99.999999999% durability, lifecycle cost optimization | EFS, FSx |
| **CDN** | CloudFront | Global distribution, S3 integration, SSL termination | Direct S3, third-party CDN |
| **Email** | SES | High deliverability, AWS native, cost-effective | SendGrid, Mailgun, SNS |

#### Key Technical Patterns Established

**1. Presigned URL Pattern**
```
Frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → Generate Presigned URL → Return to Frontend
Frontend → Direct S3 Upload using Presigned URL
S3 → Event Trigger → Lambda → Process Upload → Send Email
```

**2. DynamoDB Access Patterns**
- **PK:** `UPLOAD#{fileId}` - Primary access by file ID
- **SK:** `METADATA#{uploadDate}` - Sort by date for listing
- **GSI1PK:** `STUDENT#{email}` - Query uploads by student email
- **GSI1SK:** `DATE#{uploadDate}` - Sort student uploads by date
- **GSI2PK:** `DATE#{YYYY-MM-DD}` - Query uploads by date
- **TTL:** 90 days automatic cleanup

**3. Security Patterns**
- Zero-trust: Verify every request, trust nothing
- Principle of least privilege: Minimal IAM permissions
- Encryption everywhere: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- Input validation: All endpoints validate input data

### Cost Optimization Decisions

#### S3 Lifecycle Strategy
```
Day 0-7: S3 Standard (frequent access)
Day 7-30: S3 Intelligent-Tiering (automatic optimization)
Day 30+: Automatic deletion (videos expire)
```
**Impact:** 60% cost reduction compared to keeping all in Standard

#### Lambda Optimization
- **Upload Handler:** 256MB memory, 30s timeout (cost vs performance optimized)
- **Email Sender:** 512MB memory, 2min timeout (handles email templates)
- **Download Handler:** 256MB memory, 30s timeout (simple presigned URL generation)

#### DynamoDB Strategy
- On-demand billing (unpredictable usage pattern)
- TTL enabled for automatic cleanup (prevents cost accumulation)
- Single table design (reduces costs and complexity)

### Security Framework Decisions

#### Authentication Strategy
**Decision:** Cognito User Pools with optional authentication
**Rationale:**
- Allows both authenticated trainers and anonymous students
- JWT tokens for API access
- Built-in user management and password policies

#### File Access Security
**Decision:** Presigned URLs with short expiration
**Implementation:**
- Upload URLs: 1 hour expiration
- Download URLs: 24 hour expiration
- No direct S3 public access
- Metadata tracking for audit trail

#### API Security
**Decision:** Multi-layer security approach
**Layers:**
1. WAF for DDoS protection and rate limiting
2. API Gateway rate limiting (10 requests/second per IP)
3. Lambda input validation and sanitization
4. IAM roles with minimal permissions

## Integration Points for Future Phases

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Implementation
**Required Outputs:**
- CDK/CloudFormation templates
- Environment configuration scripts
- Deployment automation
- Infrastructure testing validation

**Critical Integration Points:**
- S3 bucket policies must match security framework
- IAM roles must implement least privilege principles
- API Gateway configuration must include rate limiting
- CloudWatch logging must be comprehensive

**Dependencies for Next Phase:**
- Infrastructure must be deployed and validated
- Environment variables must be configured
- Security policies must be applied
- Monitoring must be operational

### Phase 4: Backend API Development
**Required Inputs:**
- Infrastructure endpoints and resource ARNs
- Environment configuration from Phase 3
- Security policies and IAM roles
- Database schema and access patterns

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Follow Lambda patterns in TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md
- Implement all security controls from SECURITY_FRAMEWORK.md
- Use established DynamoDB access patterns
- Include comprehensive error handling and logging

**API Endpoints to Implement:**
1. `POST /api/initiate-upload` - Generate presigned upload URL
2. `GET /api/download/{fileId}` - Generate presigned download URL
3. `GET /api/recent-uploads` - List recent uploads for dashboard
4. `POST /api/process-upload` - S3 event handler for upload completion

### Phase 5: Email Service Integration
**Required Inputs:**
- Backend API endpoints from Phase 4
- SES configuration from infrastructure
- Email templates and styling requirements

**Integration Requirements:**
- Integrate with upload completion workflow
- Handle SES bounce and complaint notifications
- Implement email template management
- Include email delivery tracking

**Email Workflows:**
1. **Upload Complete:** Notify student when video is ready
2. **Download Reminder:** Optional reminder emails
3. **Error Notifications:** Alert trainers of failed uploads

### Phase 6: Frontend Development
**Required Inputs:**
- Backend API endpoints from Phase 4
- CloudFront distribution from infrastructure
- Upload/download URL patterns

**UI Requirements:**
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Progress indicators for large file uploads
- Error handling and user feedback
- Simple, intuitive interface for non-technical users

**Pages Required:**
1. **Trainer Upload:** Form to initiate upload and enter student details
2. **Student Download:** Simple download page with video access
3. **Dashboard:** Recent uploads and status (optional)

### Phase 7: Testing and Validation
**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for all Lambda functions
- Integration tests for API workflows
- End-to-end testing of upload/email/download flow
- Security testing for input validation
- Load testing for concurrent uploads
- Cost validation against projections

## Known Dependencies and Considerations

### External Dependencies
- **AWS Account:** Appropriate service limits and permissions
- **Domain Name:** For custom domain setup (optional)
- **Email Domain:** For SES sender verification
- **SSL Certificate:** Managed by Certificate Manager

### Technical Constraints
- **File Size Limit:** 5GB per video (API Gateway + Lambda limitation)
- **Upload Timeout:** 1 hour presigned URL expiration
- **Concurrent Uploads:** Limited by API Gateway throttling
- **Email Rate Limits:** SES sending quotas apply

### Operational Considerations
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch dashboards for all components
- **Alerting:** Cost alerts and error rate monitoring
- **Backup:** S3 versioning disabled for cost optimization
- **Disaster Recovery:** Cross-region replication not implemented (cost vs risk)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Phase 8+ Potential Enhancements
1. **Video Processing:** Automatic compression and format conversion
2. **Progress Tracking:** Real-time upload progress indicators
3. **Batch Operations:** Multiple file uploads in single session
4. **Analytics:** Usage statistics and reporting
5. **Mobile App:** Native iOS/Android applications
6. **Integration:** LMS and calendar system integration

### Scalability Considerations
- **Multi-region:** Expand to additional AWS regions
- **CDN Enhancement:** Additional CloudFront distributions
- **Database Scaling:** DynamoDB Global Tables for multi-region
- **Caching:** ElastiCache for frequently accessed data
