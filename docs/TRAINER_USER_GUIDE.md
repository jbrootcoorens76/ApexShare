## Managing Your Content

### Understanding Video Lifecycle

### Tracking Video Status

Currently, ApexShare doesn't provide a dashboard for tracking uploaded videos. Each upload is independent and self-contained. For your records, we recommend:

1. **Keep a Log**: Maintain a simple spreadsheet with:
   - Upload date
   - Student name and email
   - Video title
   - Expected expiration date (upload date + 7 days)

2. **Email Confirmations**: Save the email confirmations you receive for your records
