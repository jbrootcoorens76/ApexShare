## Problem Statement

### Initial Challenge
ApexShare's basic upload system exhibited severe performance degradation under concurrent upload scenarios, common when motorcycle trainers upload multiple GoPro videos simultaneously after training sessions.

### Performance Issues Identified
1. **Bandwidth Competition:** Multiple uploads competing for limited bandwidth
2. **Memory Inefficiency:** Poor memory management during large file uploads
