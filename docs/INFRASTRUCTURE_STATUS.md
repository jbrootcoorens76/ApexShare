- Lambda functions have basic structure and error handling
- Environment variables configured for resource ARNs
- CloudWatch logging enabled for all functions

### ðŸ”§ Temporarily Disabled (Advanced Features)

#### 5. Email Stack
**Status:** ðŸ”§ Deferred - SES Configuration Complexity
**Reason for Deferral:** SES configuration requires domain verification and reputation management setup that adds complexity without blocking core functionality.

**Original Components:**
- SES email service configuration
- Email templates for notifications
- Bounce and complaint handling
- Email delivery monitoring

**Future Implementation:**
- Can be added as separate stack after core deployment
- Does not block upload/download core workflow
- Email notifications can be implemented via external service initially

#### 6. Frontend Stack
**Status:** ðŸ”§ Deferred - CloudFront Integration Issues
**Reason for Deferral:** CloudFront distribution configuration dependencies add complexity that can be addressed after core API is functional.

**Original Components:**
- CloudFront distribution for global content delivery
- S3 static website hosting configuration
- Custom domain integration
- Cache optimization policies

**Future Implementation:**
- Static website can be hosted directly on S3 initially
- CloudFront can be added later for performance optimization
- Core upload functionality works without CDN

#### 7. Monitoring Stack
**Status:** ðŸ”§ Deferred - Advanced Dashboard Configuration
**Reason for Deferral:** Advanced CloudWatch dashboards are nice-to-have; basic CloudWatch logging is included in core stacks.

**Original Components:**
- Custom CloudWatch dashboards
- Advanced metric filters and alarms
- Cost monitoring dashboards
- Performance analytics

**Current Monitoring:**
- Basic CloudWatch logging enabled in all Lambda functions
- AWS Config for compliance monitoring (Security Stack)
- CloudTrail for audit logging (Security Stack)
- Default service metrics available

#### 8. Cost Optimization Stack
**Status:** ðŸ”§ Deferred - AWS SDK v3 Compatibility Issues
**Reason for Deferral:** Advanced cost tracking requires AWS SDK v3 migration that introduces additional complexity.

**Original Components:**
- Advanced cost tracking Lambda functions
- Billing alerts and notifications
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Automated cost optimization recommendations

**Current Cost Controls:**
- S3 lifecycle policies for automatic cost reduction
- DynamoDB TTL for data cleanup
- On-demand billing for DynamoDB
- Basic CloudWatch billing alerts
