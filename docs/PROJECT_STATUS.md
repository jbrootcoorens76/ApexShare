## Critical Path Analysis

### Current Critical Path
1. ‚úÖ Architecture Foundation ‚Üí ‚úÖ Security Framework ‚Üí üîÑ **Infrastructure Implementation**
2. Infrastructure ‚Üí Backend API Development
3. Backend API ‚Üí Email Service + Frontend Development (parallel)
4. All Components ‚Üí Testing and Validation

### Next Immediate Action Required
**Priority 1:** Start Infrastructure Implementation
- Agent: aws-infrastructure-engineer
- Duration: 1-2 days
- Blockers: None - all prerequisites complete

## Key Architecture Decisions Made

### Service Selection Rationale
- **API Gateway:** Managed service with built-in throttling and CORS support
- **Lambda:** Zero server management with automatic scaling and pay-per-invocation
- **S3:** 99.999999999% durability with unlimited storage and lifecycle policies
- **DynamoDB:** NoSQL serverless database with automatic scaling and single-digit latency
- **SES:** High deliverability email service with cost-effective pricing
- **CloudFront:** Global CDN with SSL termination and S3 integration

### Security Architecture Decisions
- Zero-trust architecture with verification of every request
- Principle of least privilege for all IAM roles
- Encryption everywhere (data at rest and in transit)
- Comprehensive auditing and monitoring
- Defense-in-depth security across all tiers

### Cost Optimization Decisions
- S3 lifecycle policies for automatic cost reduction
- DynamoDB TTL for data cleanup
- Optimized Lambda memory allocation
- CloudWatch billing alerts for cost monitoring
- Pay-per-use serverless architecture

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
**Low Risk:** Project foundation is solid with comprehensive documentation
**Medium Risk:** None identified at this stage
**High Risk:** None identified at this stage

### Mitigation Strategies
- All foundation documents are complete and implementation-ready
- Security framework addresses all major threat vectors
- Cost optimization strategies are built into the architecture
- Clear agent dependencies and integration points documented

## Budget and Cost Tracking

### Estimated AWS Costs (Monthly)
**Development Phase:** ~$50-100/month
**Production (Low Usage):** ~$20-50/month
**Production (High Usage):** ~$100-500/month

**Cost optimization measures built-in:**
- S3 lifecycle policies reduce storage costs by 60%
- DynamoDB TTL prevents cost accumulation
- Lambda pay-per-invocation model
- CloudWatch billing alerts for cost monitoring
