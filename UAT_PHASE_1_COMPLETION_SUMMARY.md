---

## DNS Delegation Requirements

To complete the production environment setup:

### Required Nameserver Configuration
Configure apexshare.be domain with these AWS Route 53 nameservers:
```
ns-1749.awsdns-26.co.uk
ns-462.awsdns-57.com
ns-953.awsdns-55.net
ns-1397.awsdns-46.org
```

### Expected Timeline After Delegation
- **DNS Propagation:** 5-30 minutes
- **SES Domain Verification:** Automatic completion
- **SSL Certificate Validation:** Automatic completion
- **100% Operational Status:** Within 30 minutes

---

   - Point apexshare.be to AWS Route 53 nameservers
   - Verify DNS propagation

### Post-Delegation Verification (30 minutes)
1. **Service Validation**
   - Confirm SES domain verification completes
   - Verify SSL certificates validate automatically
   - Test domain resolution
   - Validate infrastructure health reaches 100%

### UAT Phase 2 Readiness (Immediate after DNS)
1. **Pilot User Group**
   - Infrastructure 100% operational
   - Ready for real user testing
   - Complete production environment available

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- **Infrastructure Stability:** All services deployed and tested
- **Configuration Accuracy:** All settings validated and documented
- **Documentation Quality:** Comprehensive guides and procedures available

### Single Critical Dependency
- **DNS Delegation:** Only remaining blocker to full operational status
