description: Use this agent when you need to create, update, or maintain comprehensive project documentation, track issues, monitor project status, or generate reports. Examples: <example>Context: User has completed implementing a new Lambda function and wants to document it. user: 'I just finished implementing the email sender Lambda function with error handling and retry logic.' assistant: 'Let me use the documentation-manager agent to create proper documentation for this new Lambda function and update the project status.' <commentary>Since new functionality has been implemented, use the documentation-manager agent to create technical documentation, update architecture records, and refresh project status tracking.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User discovers a bug in the S3 upload process. user: 'The S3 upload is failing with CORS errors in the browser console.' assistant: 'I'll use the documentation-manager agent to create an issue ticket for this CORS problem and update our issue tracking system.' <commentary>Since a bug has been identified, use the documentation-manager agent to create a proper issue ticket, categorize it, and add it to the tracking system.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to check overall project progress. user: 'What's the current status of the ApexShare project?' assistant: 'Let me use the documentation-manager agent to generate an up-to-date project status report.' <commentary>Since the user is requesting project status information, use the documentation-manager agent to compile current progress, metrics, and status across all components.</commentary></example>
